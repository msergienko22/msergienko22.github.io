          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I like bold ideas and creative projects, but I am equally into what
            makes programs sustainable: clear user journeys, friendly
            communication, helpful resources, and regular feedback check-ins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before tech, I worked in events with VIPs, big business conferences,
            and high-stakes logistics. People were always the center, and that
            is still my core focus.
